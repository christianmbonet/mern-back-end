# MERN STACK BACK-END

This is a practice build.

## WHAT I DID:

Setting up a MERN stack back-end

## HOW I DID IT:

## PACKAGES:

/node_modules: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

/src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for “source code”.

.gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

.prettierrc: This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

gatsby-browser.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

package-lock.json (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won’t change this file directly).

package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

README.md: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

nodemon: Monitors any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.

express: node web app framework for building back-end server.
